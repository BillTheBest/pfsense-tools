vCloudBSD is an iso designed for cloud operators that allows rapid deployment
of a FreeBSD machine.

On first bootup vCloudBSD will automatically install to the first hard disk
that it finds and then reboot.

On second bootup it will wait 15 seconds for a operator to hit a key to set
first boot items such as IP address, hostname etc.

After this the machine will boot and puppet will automatically start to finish
the machines provisioning.
