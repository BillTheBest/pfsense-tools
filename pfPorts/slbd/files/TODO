This Release
===============================
 - go through all source looking for XXX or FIXME's
 - add error-handling for ruleset ioctl(2)s

High Priority
===============================
 - modify rule adding/updating to manipulate rules in an anchor
 - make sure pfctl'ing can handle it when pfctl reloads rulesets, clearing
   anchors

Medium Priority
===============================
 - figure out how to dynamically remove a VSVC from the ruleset:
 	+ renumbering of the other rules
 	+ recalculate the vsvc_t rule_nr fields
 	+ avoid sending lots of RSTs
 - allow a HUP to reinitialize the data structures from the configfile
 - add dirty flags and logic to avoid reloading rules if none dirty
 - add assert() statements to strategic locations to barf if bad things
   happen during debugging 
 - suggest updating pf man page to say that DIOCCOMMITRULES does not, in
   fact, ignore the action field
 - suggest a note to daniel about the rpool proxy ports being host order
   while the addresses are network order
 - add ability to expect strings back from TCP connections
 - make inet_ntoa's reentrant
 - make all printing functions reentrant
 - add ability to send SNMP traps
 - add stateful logging of real service-up and service-down notifications to
   minimize number of alerts

Low Priority
===============================
 - add ability to use something other than TCP-based load balancing
 - add backup sitedown site and polling thereof
 - add ability to pause TCP connection before looking for expect string
   from plain TCP polls
