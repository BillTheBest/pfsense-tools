The DSL Modem Tool, as created by A. Matthoefer, is a useful utility
for Diagnosis and Tuning of DSL Modems. Sadly, it only works on
Windows. So I started reimplementing it on Linux.

DMT-UX should be able to communicate with all Thomson Speedtouch
Modems and compatible devices. It was tested successfully with:

 * Thomson Speedtouch 516i V6
