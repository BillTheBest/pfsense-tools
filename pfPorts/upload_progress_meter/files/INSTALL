Quick install: 

1. compile
   This extension was tested with PHP versions 4.3.7/8/10 and 5.0.0/3

phpize
./configure
make 
make install
   
   Notice the directory where the extension was installed.

2. edit your php.ini and add on line like this:

extension=no-debug-non-zts-20020429/upload_progress_tracking.so

it is possible that you will need to copy it somewhere else, or to edit the extension_dir directive
in your php.ini to point to the correct path.

mine looks like this:
extension_dir = /usr/local/lib/php/extensions

and I have the extension in this place: 
/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20020429/upload_progress_tracking.so

3. edit php.ini or apache's httpd.conf to configure the upload-progress-tracking

I have this in my httpd.conf:
php_value upload_progress_tracking.store_method "file"
php_value upload_progress_tracking.file 1
php_value upload_progress_tracking.file.filename_template "/tmp/uploadbar/upl_%s.txt"


4. don't forget to mkdir /tmp/uploadbar ; chmod 777 /tmp/uploadbar
